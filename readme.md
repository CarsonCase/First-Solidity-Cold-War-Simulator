This is done as a learning for my first solidity project.
This should not be referenced, thought of as secure or really even admired. I'm really just keeping it here so I and future recruiters have an idea of when I started
learning Solidity and how my progress has advanced. Note that this only works on a local environment and is super buggy. I had a lot of problems getting it to work
but it was very fun to make. More projects on the way!
